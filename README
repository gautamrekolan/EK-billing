This is a web application written in Rails 3 with a MySQL backend. 
It is my first foray into Ruby, Rails, and all the magic therein.

That said, it exists as a simple and easy billing application to allow horse trainers, barn owners/managers and 
anyone else running an equine operation the ability to build, track and maintain their customers and associated 
invoices. It also allows these managers the ability to create accounts for their customers, who can then log in 
and view their invoices, make credit card payments online (via authorize.net) against their invoices, keep their 
personal information up to date, and more. The application also offers features like the uploading of documents 
related to the barn, its customers, and their horses.

Future road map includes mobile apps for use on the go, as well as some awesome ideas for use on iPads and other tablets.

More to come as features continue to be developed!
